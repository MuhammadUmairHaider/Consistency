    - The specific metrics or aspects being discussed
    Answer True if:
    - The new query is a direct follow-up or clarification of the previous topic
    - It asks for more details about the same type of data and time period
    Answer False if:
    - The new query introduces a new type of data or metric
    - It asks about a significantly different time period
    - It's not a natural continuation of the previous conversation

    New query (True): "Can you give me more details about my deep sleep"
    New query (False): "insigns in april elaborate"
