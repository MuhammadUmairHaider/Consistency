My fascination with computers began in childhood when I spent countless hours troubleshooting issues with my personal computer, which I initially used for gaming. The process of diagnosing problems, experimenting with solutions, and eventually restoring functionality sparked my curiosity about how these systems work. This early exposure to problem-solving nurtured a deep interest in technology, leading me to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, where I could explore my passion on a broader scale.
During my undergraduate studies, I discovered the transformative potential of machine learning and neural networks while studying machine learning. I was captivated by how simple mathematical principles, when scaled and combined, could exhibit what we call intelligence. This revelation motivated me to delve deeper into these concepts, working on projects and coursework that emphasized artificial intelligence and data-driven systems. I experimented by choosing random datasets from the internet and training machine learning models to learn how these models work. By the time I completed my degree, I was certain that I wanted to pursue research in AI, specifically focusing on areas that push the boundaries of what machines can achieve.
After graduation, I took the initiative to expand my understanding of advanced machine learning techniques. I began by studying online resources to build foundational knowledge. Took the famous machine learning course by Andrew Ng. It taught me fundamental mathematical understanding of machine learning algorithms which I initially struggled with. I eventually collaborated with professor Abu Bakar Siddique(University of Kentucky)  to gain hands-on research experience. My work focused on transformer models, particularly in optimizing user context integration for next-token predictions. It was focused on decoder only models. This research allowed me to understand the intricacies of transformer architectures and how they can be tailored to improve language model performance in real-world applications. I used GPT2 for baseline and built upon that. My role was to design an algorithm that understood user interaction history better than baseline GPT2 and performs better on the recommendation task. I ended up improving the accuracy considerably. We are still testing the model for its response generation abilities. The experience not only honed my technical skills but also deepened my appreciation for collaborative research and innovation. During research, I worked on pytorch, numpy, pandas and various other related libraries. I gained experience in designing, implementing, and testing various models and algorithms. Apart from that, I also learned to manage, modify, structure and use data for training and testing machine learning models.
Following my academic work, I joined Crective digital marketing company as Senior Machine Learning/Python Engineer, where I contributed to building automation tools powered by large language models (LLMs). My role involved developing systems that facilitated user interactions through conversational AI and automating decisions and actions based on these interactions. This experience reinforced my understanding of LLMs' practical applications and limitations, particularly in environments where precise decision-making is critical. It also highlighted the challenges of designing robust systems that can reliably interpret and respond to user intent. I solely designed and programmed AI tools that assisted the company in automating their basic workflow, reducing repetitive work which required constant human effort to simply just ordering the program to do it. I worked on 3 different projects. First one was a program designed to negotiate and sell company services to users via email which acted as customer service and purchase agent on behalf of the company, Program also automatically provided the service which was posting content on a site but it relied on admin to confirm payments of users before providing them the service. This program reduced the effort required to deal with customers. Second one was similar but instead of selling services, it negotiated prices for services to be purchased from third parties. Both these programs communicated with users through email. Third program was a content writing assistant that wrote structured articles based on user input and posted them on sites according to a given schedule. I gained valuable programming experience while working there and learned to convert bare AI models into a form where they can be used conveniently for specific tasks.
My recent interests have shifted toward creating AI models that can interact with and understand their environments beyond conversations. While working on automation tools, I observed that language-based models lack contextual depth and environmental understanding, making them prone to errors in scenarios where they are being used to interact with the environment instead of simply talking. They also require extensive manual checks and programming to achieve reliable performance. This has inspired me to explore how AI can integrate multi-modal inputs and contextual awareness to handle more sophisticated interactions. My long-term goal is to develop systems that blend conversational intelligence with real-world situational understanding, creating models capable of adaptive, context-aware behavior.
I am confident that pursuing a PhD at [uni] will provide the ideal environment to advance these aspirations. With a strong foundation in AI and practical experience in deploying cutting-edge technologies, I am eager to contribute to research that bridges the gap between conversation-driven AI and holistic, environment-aware systems. I look forward to the opportunity to collaborate with esteemed faculty and peers, leveraging academic resources to create solutions that bring us closer to truly intelligent systems.
